### Compiler DSL

The Compiler DSL offers the low level functional API that interfaces directly with the compiler.
In this API the user is given the chance to interface with all compiler phases and steps of compilation.
Interfacing with the compiler alongside the compilation process allows the user to alter the compilation outcome by
interacting with the compiler configuration, analysis, resolution and code generation phases.
