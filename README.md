Functional companion to Kotlin's Compiler & IDE

## Getting started

Λrrow Meta is a meta-programming library that cooperates with the Kotlin compiler in all it's phases bringing its full power to the community.

Writing compiler plugins, source transformations, IDEA plugins, linters, type search engines, automatic code refactoring,... are just a few of the [use cases](#use-cases) of the things that can be accomplished with Meta.
