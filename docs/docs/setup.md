# Setup

## Î›rrow Meta Compiler Plugin

The Arrow Meta Compiler Plugin can be enabled in your project with the Arrow Meta Gradle Plugin.

The Arrow Meta Gradle Plugin will be published in the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.arrow-kt.arrow) for RELEASE versions and it will be able to be used with the plugins DSL:

```
plugins {
    id "io.arrow-kt.arrow" version "<release-version>"
}
```

If using a SNAPSHOT version, it must be included with the legacy plugin application:

```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "io.arrow-kt:gradle-plugin:<snapshot-version>"
    }
}

apply plugin: "io.arrow-kt.arrow"
```
