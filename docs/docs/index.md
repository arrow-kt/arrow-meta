# Functional companion to Kotlin's Compiler & IDE

Λrrow Meta is a meta-programming library that cooperates with the Kotlin compiler in all its phases, bringing its full power to the community.

Writing compiler plugins, source transformations, IDEA plugins, linters, type search engines, and automatic code refactoring are just a few of the things that can be accomplished with Meta.
